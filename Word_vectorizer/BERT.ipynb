    "## How BERT Works: A Deeper Basic Look\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT uses the Transformer architecture, which is based on self-attention mechanisms. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step overview of how BERT processes text:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tokenization:**\n",
    "   - The input sentence is split into tokens (words or subwords).\n",
    "   - Special tokens like `[CLS]` (start of sentence) and `[SEP]` (separator) are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Embedding:**\n",
    "   - Each token is converted into a vector (embedding).\n",
    "   - These vectors capture the meaning and position of each token.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Self-Attention & Transformer Layers:**\n",
    "   - BERT uses multiple Transformer layers to process the embeddings.\n",
    "   - Self-attention allows each token to focus on other tokens in the sentence, capturing context from both directions (left and right).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output:**\n",
    "   - The final output is a set of vectors (one for each token), which can be used for various NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have the sentence:\n",
    "```\n",
    "I love NLP\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Tokenization**\n",
    "- Tokens: `[CLS]`, `I`, `love`, `NLP`, `[SEP]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Embedding (Vector Representation)**\n",
    "- Each token is converted to a vector. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[CLS]  [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]\n",
    "I      [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, ...]\n",
    "love   [0.8, 0.9, 0.1, ...]\n",
    "NLP    [0.4, 0.2, 0.8, ...]\n",
    "[SEP]  [0.0, 0.1, 0.0, ...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "(Each vector is typically 768 or 1024 dimensions in real BERT models.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Self-Attention (Matrix Representation)**\n",
    "- The model computes attention scores between all pairs of tokens, forming an attention matrix. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "|     | [CLS] | I    | love | NLP  | [SEP] |\n",
    "|-----|-------|------|------|------|-------|\n",
    "|[CLS]| 0.2   | 0.1  | 0.3  | 0.2  | 0.2   |\n",
    "|I    | 0.1   | 0.5  | 0.2  | 0.1  | 0.1   |\n",
    "|love | 0.2   | 0.2  | 0.4  | 0.1  | 0.1   |\n",
    "|NLP  | 0.1   | 0.2  | 0.2  | 0.4  | 0.1   |\n",
    "|[SEP]| 0.2   | 0.1  | 0.2  | 0.2  | 0.3   |\n",
    "```\n",
    "(Each value shows how much one token attends to another.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Output Vectors**\n",
    "- After several layers, BERT outputs a vector for each token, now enriched with context from the whole sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "These vectors can then be used for tasks like classification, question answering, or named entity recognition."

    "# Basic Understanding of BERT Model\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a state-of-the-art language representation model developed by Google in 2018. It is designed to understand the context of a word in search queries and natural language processing (NLP) tasks by considering the words that come before and after it (bidirectional context).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bidirectional Context:** Unlike traditional models that read text input sequentially (left-to-right or right-to-left), BERT reads the entire sequence of words at once, allowing it to learn the context of a word based on all of its surroundings.\n",
    "- **Transformer Architecture:** BERT is based on the Transformer architecture, which uses self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence.\n",
    "- **Pre-training and Fine-tuning:** BERT is first pre-trained on a large corpus of text using unsupervised tasks (Masked Language Model and Next Sentence Prediction). It is then fine-tuned on specific tasks like question answering, sentiment analysis, or named entity recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question Answering\n",
    "- Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "- Named Entity Recognition\n",
    "- Text Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Achieves state-of-the-art results on many NLP benchmarks.\n",
    "- Can be fine-tuned for a wide range of NLP tasks with minimal architecture changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requires significant computational resources for training.\n",
    "- Large model size can be challenging for deployment on resource-constrained devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT has significantly advanced the field of NLP and is widely used in both academia and industry for various language understanding tasks."
